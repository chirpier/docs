# Core Concepts

Familiarize yourself with Chirpier's core concepts and terminology to get a better understanding of how Chirpier works and how you can make the most of its features.

## Groups

Groups are who you're monitoring. A group can be a specific team, a whole
organisation, or a particular customer.

All accounts come with a Default Group for emitting data. Create a new group by navigating to the **Groups** page.

You can send measurement stream data for your group via our [SDK](/docs/emit-data/sdk) or [API](/docs/emit-data/api).

## Streams

Streams are what you want to measure against a monitoring group. This can be anything,
such as website clicks, completed orders, or measurements from IoT
devices.

Create a stream by navigating to the **Streams** page.

Once you've set up a monitoring stream, you can start sending stream data for your stream via our [SDK](/docs/emit-data/sdk) or [API](/docs/emit-data/api).

## Charts

Once you've emitted data to Chirpier, you can create and publish Charts in our Charts page. This is where the magic happens.

Chirpier Charts will update in real-time in any modern browser, when data is emitted to Chirpier. So no need for browser refreshes.
Chirpier supports four chart types:

- **Summary**: Display a summary of your data with a text-based visualization
- **Tracker**: Show data in a column-based tracking view
- **Bar**: Visualize data using bar charts
- **Line**: Plot data points on a line graph

For each chart, you can configure:

- Chart name and stream selection
- Data fallback strategy (none, zero, last, or cumulative) for handling missing data points
- Aggregation methods (sum, count, average, max, min) for line and bar charts
- Custom colors for visual styling
- Sharing options with optional password protection

Charts can be reordered by dragging and dropping, and will automatically update in real-time as new data arrives.

## Alert Policies

Policies allow you to define monitoring rules for your data streams. Each policy can be configured with:

- Enable/disable toggle to activate or pause monitoring
- Group and stream selection to specify what to monitor
- Policy name and description for identification
- Monitoring period (minute, hour, or day) for time-based analysis
- Aggregation method (sum, count, average, max, min) for data processing
- Condition operators (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.) for threshold checks
- Threshold value to trigger alerts
- Alert severity levels (info, warning, error, critical) for prioritization

This gives you the ability to monitor when your stream has exceeded a certain threshold in a minute, hour, or day.

Once configured, policies will evaluate incoming data against these rules and trigger alerts when conditions are met.

[Read more about Policies](monitor/policies).

## Alerts

View your alert notifications that have been triggered by your Alert Policies.

## Integration token

Your Integration token authorizes requests to Chirpier - and are personal to you. This is all you need to start emitting data to Chirpier.

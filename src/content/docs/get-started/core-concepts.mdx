# Core Concepts

Familiarize yourself with Chirpier's core concepts and terminology to get a better understanding of how Chirpier works and how you can make the most of its features.

## Groups

Groups are who you're monitoring. A group can be a specific team, a whole
organisation, or a particular customer.

All accounts come with a Default Group for emitting data. Create a new group by navigating to the [Groups](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/groups) page.

You can send measurement stream data for your group via our [SDK](/docs/emit/sdk) or [API](/docs/emit/api).

## Streams

Streams are what you want to measure against a monitoring group. This can be anything,
such as website clicks, completed orders, or measurements from IoT devices.

Create a stream by navigating to the [Streams](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/streams) page.

Once you've set up a monitoring stream, you can start emitting data via our [SDK](/docs/emit/sdk) or [API](/docs/emit/api).

## Charts

Once you've emitted data to Chirpier, you can create and publish Charts in our [Charts](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/charts) page. This is where the magic happens.

Chirpier Charts will update in any modern web browser, immediately as data is emitted to Chirpier. So there's no need for browser refreshes or waiting for data warehouse updates.

Chirpier currently supports four real-time chart types for any stream:

- [Summary](/docs/charts/summary): Display a summary of your data with a text-based visualization
- [Tracker](/docs/charts/tracker): Show data in a column-based tracking view
- [Bar](/docs/charts/bar): Visualize data using bar charts
- [Line](/docs/charts/line): Plot data points on a line graph

For each chart, you can configure:

- Chart name
- Data fallback strategy (none, zero, last, or cumulative) for handling missing data points
- Aggregation methods (sum, count, average, max, min) for line and bar charts
- Custom colors for visual styling
- Sharing options with optional password protection

Charts can be reordered in your dashboard, and will automatically update in real-time as new data arrives.

## Alert policies

[Alert Policies](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/policies) allow you to define monitoring rules for your data streams. Each policy can be configured with:

- Enable/disable toggle to activate or pause monitoring
- Group and stream selection to specify what to monitor
- Policy name and description for identification
- Monitoring period (minute, hour, or day) for time-based analysis
- Aggregation method (sum, count, average, max, min) for data processing
- Condition operators (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.) for threshold checks
- Threshold value to trigger alerts
- Alert severity levels (info, warning, error, critical) for prioritization

This gives you the ability to monitor when your stream has exceeded a certain threshold in a minute, hour, or day. E.g., if your stream has exceeded 100 clicks in a minute, or 1000 clicks in an hour.

Once configured, policies will evaluate incoming data against these rules and trigger alerts when conditions are met.

## Integration token

Your Integration token authorizes requests to Chirpier and are personal to you. This is all you need to start emitting data to Chirpier. You can find your token in the [Integration](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/integration) page.

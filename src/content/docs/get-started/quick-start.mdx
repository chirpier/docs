# Quick Start

With Chirpier, you can ingest data from anywhere, and create real-time charts and dashboards in seconds.

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create an account

Chirpier has a free tier for any proof of concept, so anyone can start building today. Create a free account [here](https://www.chirpier.co/auth)
using a GitHub, GitLab, Google, or your email address.

### Find your integration token

Navigate to the [Integration](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/integration) page to find your personal token.
Copy your personal token, and use it to authenticate the events you send to the Chirpier service.

### Emit

Identify your monitoring groups - these are who you're monitoring. A group can be a specific team, a whole
organisation, or a particular customer.
All Chirpier teams have a default monitoring group, and you can create additional groups.

Once you've a monitoring group, you can start sending stream data for your group via our [SDK](/docs/emit/sdk) or [API](/docs/emit/api).

This is as simple as a few lines of code with:

- Your personal token
- Your **group ID**
- Your **stream name**
- The **value** of the stream

### Chart

Navigate to your [Charts dashboard](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/charts), and create a chart in your
authenticated dashboard.
Our mutli-tenanted architecture means only you and your team will see the data you&apos;ve sent us with your
personal token.

### Monitor

Set up your [alert policies](/docs/monitor/policies) to monitor your data streams and trigger alerts when conditions are met.

# Quick Start

With Chirpier, you can ingest data from anywhere, and create real-time charts and dashboards in seconds.

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create an account

Chirpier has a free tier for any proof of concept, so anyone can start building today. Create a free account [here](https://www.chirpier.co/auth)
using a GitHub, GitLab Google, or your email address.

### Find your integration token

Navigate to the **Integration** page to find your personal token.
Use your personal token to send data to the Chirpier service.

### Emit

Identify your monitoring groups - these are who you're monitoring. A group can be a specific team, a whole
organisation, or a particular customer.

Once you've set up a monitoring group, you can start sending stream data for your group via our [SDK](/docs/emit-data/sdk) or [API](/docs/emit-data/api).

### Chart

Log in to your account with Chirpier, and view your charts in our
authenticated dashboard. Our mutli-tenanted architecture means only
you and your team will see the data you&apos;ve sent us with your
API key.

### Monitor

Set up your alert policies to monitor your data streams and trigger alerts when conditions are met.

## Additional properties

Here are the additional properties you can configure for your tracker chart:

- The stream aggregation setting for your chart:
  - Sum: Total of all values for a stream in a time window
  - Count: Number of data points for a stream in a time window
  - Average: Mean value for a stream in a time window
  - Maximum: Highest value for a stream in a time window
  - Minimum: Lowest value for a stream in a time window
- The condition for the tracker:
  - Greater than: The tracker will be green if the value is greater than the condition
  - Less than: The tracker will be green if the value is less than the condition
  - Equal to: The tracker will be green if the value is equal to the condition
- The threshold for monitoring the aggregation value

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    margin: "25px",
    maxWidth: "500px",
    border: "0.5px solid #e0e0e0",
    borderRadius: "10px",
  }}
>
  ![Tracker Chart Options](/tracker-options.png)
</div>

The tracker chart will then display a green or red indicator based on the condition and threshold.

- Green: The tracker will be green if the value meets the condition of the threshold
- Red: The tracker will be red if the value does not meet the condition of the threshold

  - Acknowledgment status
- Search for specific alerts by policy name
- Acknowledge alerts by clicking the checkbox icon
- View alert details by clicking on an alert row
- See your connection status (Connected/Connecting) in real-time
- Access your policies page directly through the link

    margin: "25px",

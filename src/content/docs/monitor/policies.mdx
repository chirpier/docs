# Policies

Alert Policies are used to generate alerts to your team - if a stream value for a given time window meets the threshold for a condition specified.
This guide shows you how to create a new alert policy in your [Policies page](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/policies).

## Create a policy

To create a new policy click **New Policy** on the [Policies page](https://www.chirpier.co/teams/policies)

When creating a new policy, you have the following configuration options:

### Basic Settings

- **Enabled** - Toggle to enable or disable the policy
- **Group** - Select which group this policy belongs to
- **Stream** - Select which data stream this policy monitors
- **Name** - Give your policy a descriptive name
- **Description** - Optionally add details about the policy's purpose

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    margin: "25px",
    maxWidth: "500px",
    border: "0.5px solid #e0e0e0",
    borderRadius: "10px",
  }}

</div>

### Alert Parameters

- **Period** - Choose the monitoring time window for the policy:
  - Minute - Monitor data over 1 minute interval
  - Hour - Monitor data over 1 hour interval
  - Day - Monitor data over 1 day interval
- **Aggregate** - Select how to aggregate data points:
  - Sum - Total of all values emitted in a given time window
  - Count - Number of data points emitted in a given time window
  - Average - Mean value emitted in a given time window
  - Max - Maximum value emitted in a given time window
  - Min - Minimum value emitted in a given time window
- **Condition** - Set the threshold condition for the policy in a given time window:
  - Greater Than - Alert when value exceeds threshold
  - Less Than - Alert when value falls below threshold
  - Greater Than or Equal - Alert when value meets or exceeds threshold
  - Less Than or Equal - Alert when value meets or falls below threshold
- **Threshold** - The numeric value to compare against for the policy
- **Severity** - Set the importance level of alerts:
  - Info - Low priority information
  - Warning - Potential issues
  - Error - Serious problems
  - Critical - Urgent issues requiring immediate attention

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    margin: "25px",
    maxWidth: "500px",
    border: "0.5px solid #e0e0e0",
    borderRadius: "10px",
  }}

</div>

Once you've configured your policy - alerts will be generated if the stream value meets the threshold for the condition specified, and members in your team will be alerted via email.

### Example

Let's say you want to monitor a temperature sensor in a server room. You could create a policy with these settings:

- **Name**: Server Room Temperature Alert
- **Description**: Monitor server room temperature for overheating
- **Period**: Minute
- **Aggregate**: Average
- **Condition**: Greater Than
- **Threshold**: 30
- **Severity**: Critical

This policy would:

1. Calculate the average temperature emitted to Chirpier every minute
2. Trigger a critical alert if the average temperature exceeds 30Â°C
3. Notify team members immediately of potential server room cooling issues

This allows for quick response to prevent equipment damage from overheating.

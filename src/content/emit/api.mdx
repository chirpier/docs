# API

Chirpier provides multiple ways to send data to our platform:

1. [Official SDKs](/emit/sdk) for popular programming languages
2. [API](/emit/api) over HTTPS for direct integration

## Direct API

It's also possible to send data to Chirpier using our API, using our events API.

  - `group_id` (UUID): The unique monitoring group identifier
  - `stream_name` (str): A unique stream name as the measurement name
  - `value` (float): Numeric value to record as the measurement value

```bash

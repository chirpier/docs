# Temperature Monitoring

Here's an example of creating a line chart showing the temperature:

1. Navigate to the **Charts** page
2. Click **New Chart** in the top right
3. Choose "Line" as the chart type
4. Configure the chart:
   - GroupID: `default`
   - Stream: `temperature`
   - Aggregation: `Average`
   - Fallback strategy: `Last` - this will fill in missing data with the last known value
5. Add a title: "Temperatures"
6. Save the chart to your workspace

Your chart will automatically update as new data comes into your data source.

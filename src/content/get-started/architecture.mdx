# Architecture

Chirpier allows you to ingest data from any application source and create real-time charts and dashboards in seconds.

## Where does Chirpier fit in your tech stack?

Chirpier is a <Translate text="visualization" /> and monitoring backend for your applications: it consumes data from any application source, and allows you to create real-time charts and dashboards in seconds.

Chirpier sits parallel to your Data Warehouse, if you still need one. The Data Warehouse allows you to explore use cases like BI and data science, while Chirpier unlocks <Translate text="visualization" /> and monitoring use cases for operational applications, and user-facing analytics.

## Is data stored in Chirpier?

Yes, the data you emit to Chirpier runs through our internal data pipeline and is stored in a high performance, time-series database.

## Cloud environment vs on-premises

Chirpier is a managed SaaS solution. We don't provide "Bring Your Own Cloud" (BYOC) or on-premises deployments, yet.

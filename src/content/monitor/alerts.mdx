The alert page shows all the alerts that have been sent to your team. You can:

- View all alerts in a table format showing:
  - Policy name
  - Alert status
  - When the alert was triggered
  - Alert period
  - Alert condition
  - Acknowledgment status
- Search for specific alerts by policy name
- Acknowledge alerts by clicking the checkbox icon
- View alert details by clicking on an alert row
- See your connection status (Connected/Connecting) in real-time
- Access your policies page directly through the link

Alerts can have different statuses:
- Triggered (unacknowledged) - shown with a red cross icon
- Acknowledged - shown with a green checkmark icon

You can manage your alert settings through the policies page where you can configure the conditions that trigger alerts.
